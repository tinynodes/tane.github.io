<p>Today I&rsquo;ve set up my new independent blog <code>tane.dev</code> - it&rsquo;s something to do with my newly owned <code>.dev</code> url but also
recently I&rsquo;ve been dissatisfied with the way <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> has dealt with recent changes.</p>

<p>I am not going to go into this, but plenty of discussion can be found on Twitter.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next few weeks, I&rsquo;m planning to migrate my content over to this site, which is generated with
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and served via <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> Pages.</p>

<p>Below are a set of links to some of that existing content.  Some I may leave for now, and a couple of them I want to
re-write and republish here.</p>

<p>Hopefully though those links you as a reader would see value in what I will be writing here; I&rsquo;ve been writing software
across full stacks for over 10 years and have gained a lot of experience.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also had a lot of life experience and through that I&rsquo;ve talked about burnout and depression.
I&rsquo;ve also recently been diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 37 and I am about to begin treatment for it in a
foreign country, living in The Netherlands for just over two years because of the catastrophe that is the Brexit.</p>

<p>These topics might come up, but I will be mostly trying to focus on development topics.  My current focus is on Typescript
both on the server side, and client side with Angular, RxJS and other frameworks.</p>
