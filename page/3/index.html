<h3 id="how-lack-of-ambition-killed-my-competitor-to-github">How lack of ambition killed my competitor to GitHub</h3>

<p>What follows is a tale of sadness and procrastination and what could have been had I been a better developer. Or maybe it would have been nothing - but I like to dream that maybe in some alternative universe what happened below didn’t go down the same way.</p>

<p>Today, GitHub is one of the most popular destinations on the web for developers - in fact I don’t know any developer who doesn’t have GitHub account.</p>

<p>Any big project out there that is open source, and many private companies use it as the most productive way to share and collaborate on code.</p>

<p>Hgfront itself was a collaboration of several people - with myself leading the team and doing most of the design and coding and we had a simple idea.</p>

<p>We wanted to allow the management and creation of Mercurial respositories via a web interface - something that would allow more non-technical people to set up shared repositories.</p>

<p>At the time it wasn’t easy. You have to have an understanding of Mercurial’s web interface, Apache 2 and mod_python - and how to get them to all work together nicely.</p>

<p>We were doing this back in 2007 - as of January 2008 we came along at a reasonable pace (as this crudely made video on Youtube show) - we didn’t have a great design or anything too exciting but as a feature list, what we did have was:</p>

<p>Account and project creation
Repository creation and cloning
Issue tracking, with basic tagging and milestones
Github didn’t launch until April 2008, and I believe if we had the ambition then I could have actually done something with this. As it was no one on the team had the ambition to push through to release anything, and soon the project died. Bitbucket - a very similar project to ours launched soon after - and the rest they say is history.</p>

<p>Oh I was doing Gists too in 2006
In 2006 I also worked on a collaborative pastebin application called PasteMonkey. At the time most pastebin applications were pretty simple - they have a text entry, language selection and code output screen.</p>

<p>I wanted to build something different - so PasteMonkey was born. Out the box it had most of the standard pastebin features - including code highlighting - but also included:</p>

<p>A tab-based editor for code entry with dynamic resizing
The ability to fork and diff versions of pastes, and paginate through versions
Inline, per-line commenting (actually kind of similar to what is on Medium with the icons down the side)
Taxonomy of tagging entries, and a public discovery system
Of course all of this stuff was Ajaxy and JavaScript heavy - something that wasn’t that common at the time either.</p>

<p>I can’t find an exact date, but I think Github launched Gist in 2010 (and if anyone can correct me if I’m wrong?)</p>

<p>When I look back on this, it makes me kick myself - if only I had the ambition to push myself to do something with this software.</p>

<p>I remarked in a previous post I’m a bit of a procrastinator and it has lead to me being a 31 year old guy who had chances in the past and blew it.</p>

<p>I do believe where I live too had something to do with it - certainly at the the time Scotland had no entrepreneurial spirit - nothing like out in the US. If I wanted to do anything with this, I would have had to have based myself out of London and at the time was something I was not willing to do.</p>

<p>Of course things change - Scotland is much better at this stuff these days, but for me the time has passed on these projects.</p>

<p>I thought of trying to bring them up to date, even if just to try get some up to date screenshots - but I’m hoping to better use my time on some other projects that I hope finally I will push through that barrier with.</p>

<p>I also think it’s kind of funny that they both ended up as open source on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="my-journey-through-procrastination-and-laziness">My journey through procrastination and laziness</h2>

<p>I’ve always found one of the hardest thing for me to achieve has been to focus on the job at hand. I’ve been a professional developer for over 10 years and I look at other developers - online and my peers - and see that somehow they manage to plan effectively their time and resources to successfully complete all the tasks at hand.</p>

<p>Frankly it makes me jealous. I’ve tried several techniques that I’ve learned from reading online and in books, and never found anything that worked for me.</p>

<p>Recently though something came into my life that has been changing that, a piece of technology that finally is the perfect fit for me and that is my iPad Mini.</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/my-old-ipad.jpg" alt="My Old iPad" /></p>

<p>I switched to the Apple ecosystem just over a year ago after many years of resistance but I found that I was working with more Mac developers and found it easier to make the switch. I ditched Android after 4 years as well (I had the first G1 handset the day it came out) mostly through frustration - for the most part it just “didn’t work” as advertised.</p>

<p>By having my laptop, phone and tablet device be all in the same ecosystem it has allowed me to take advantage of some excellent tools - and these I am finding have made my work day a lot more tollerable.</p>

<p>Side note: I am not a fervent Apple “fan boy” - sometimes I find their activity still verging on a cult-like status. What I do like is that they do solid hardware and have allowed for a great set of apps to grow within their ecosystem - and for the most part it all does “just work”.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have sidetracked enough on the hardware - so lets get down to the software.</p>

<h2 id="my-indispensable-apps-list">My indispensable apps list</h2>

<p>These are the apps that I use almost every day in some way. It’s not an exhaustive list - in fact it’s rather short, but why have fifty tools when you can have a few great ones that really help. Most of them listed have a OSX and iOS version - allowing for integration of data while at home, work or on the move.</p>

<p>Through this list one thing I am not going to do is tell you how to use them - I found that is a futile exercise for most people. Everyone has their own way of using apps and this is more a guide to what tools are available to help improve everyday workflow.</p>

<h3 id="evernote-penultimate">Evernote + Penultimate</h3>

<p>Evernote was one of the first apps I used on the Mac - I had been recommended it by several people as a way to store notes online, from quick notes on the go to whole email threads that I could track the progress of. It’s one of the few apps I do have a workflow for - using The Secret Weapon GTD system, although I have found myself using it less and less these days in favour of better organised notebooks.</p>

<p>When I got my stylus pen I also installed Penultimate from Evernote as a more general note taking, and sketching app. It’s great for those crappy drawings I would make on bits of paper that I’d end up loosing - but instead now I have them synced to one central place that I can later decide to keep or dump them.</p>

<p>One aside here I would make is on stylus choice - don’t go cheap. The one I have cost me £6.99 and it shows. It’s a great addition to the iPad but I wish I had got a better quality one. I’m going to shortly upgrade to either a Bamboo or Pogo one soon, and it might be a good topic for a post in the future.</p>

<h3 id="day-one">Day One</h3>

<p>I’ve tried keeping diaries in the past - personal ones, development ones and even task-based diaries but again couldn’t find anything that encouraged me to keep it up beyond a few weeks.</p>

<p>That changed after I bought Day One. It’s not only a great note taking tool but the features it includes such as tagging, photo attachments and weather and location attachment to individual entries allows you to build up context-aware content around your daily life. Out the box it also support Markdown content, which is a great way to write your documents.</p>

<p>Integration is via iCloud or Dropbox - I’d recommend the Dropbox integration as it’s more reliable, as well as allowing you you back up to it.</p>

<p>If anything it’s the one tool I wish I used more - it does have a reminder feature, encouraging you to write your entries with pithy little messages and quotes in it’s notification popup - but I do find that if I’m not in the mood for writing or too busy, it’s easy to just tell it to go away and I forget to come back.</p>

<h3 id="ia-writer">iA Writer</h3>

<p>Before this blog post (which I am doing in Mediums own interface and loving it!) most of the more creative writing I had been doing in the past few months had been in iA Writer.</p>

<p>iA Writer has a unique interface on both OSX and iOS that provides a great distraction-free writing environment through getting rid of the standard chrome around the window, and focus mode that only highlights the lines you are working on at the time. Like Day One, it also support Markdown content.</p>

<h3 id="paper">Paper</h3>

<p>One thing I’ve always tried is to find a a hobby that isn’t coding, and while I enjoy photography I always found that I could never be bothered to carry about a bulky camera - preferring to use the likes of Instagram or Flickr on my iPhone to take pictures. Along with this I wanted to discover my more creative side and last month I found the perfect tool for it.</p>

<p>Paper is designed for iPad and stylus pens and provides a set of artistic tool for me to explore that more creative side. Within the sketchbooks it provides two pens, a pencil, a highlighter and paintbrush - along with colour palettes and mixers - driven by an ‘expressive’ ink engine.</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/ipad-painting,jpg" alt="An old iPad painting" /></p>

<p>It’s been over 15 years since I last painted anything at school - and I’ve found that it’s something I enjoy again - so I’ve combined my love for taking photos with my new found joy of using Paper - now when I walk my dog, I take notice of my surroundings and try capture pictures that I want to paint later. So far my attempts are not stunning, but it’s relaxing and certainly nice to get away from a computer screen full of code.</p>

<p>At FreeAgent one of the goals of our Customer Experience team has been to improve the quality of content on our Knowledge Base.</p>

<p>From humble beginnings it has grown into sprawling, organic collection of documents containing over 250 pages of content. Over the years has built up to cover everything from setting up FreeAgent, to telling you about the tasks you can carry out to run your business and even stubs of support responses on how certain tasks might be (or not be) carried out.</p>

<p>As part of redesigning the content we decided to implement a ‘usefulness tracker’ allowing us to gather customer metrics. We would use this information to inform us as to which articles actually helped our users and what ones ended up being dead-ends with no where else to go.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>

<p>We ended up designing a relatively simple two step process. At the bottom of every page we ask the users if they found the article useful via two buttons for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. We used a combination of a custom CMS application and Google Analytics to do the tracking.</p>

<p>If they did find an article useful, then great! We take that vote and record it against the article which allows us to see quickly which ones need less of our immediate attention. Job done.</p>

<p>However if the user said ‘no’ then we presented them with a simple comment field allowing them to give us that extra level of detail in their feedback. We hoped this would allow us to understand why that page was failing and then use that as part of a feedback loop to further improve the content.</p>

<p>We also presented the user with a friendly picture of our support team and contact details - we don’t want to abandon these users after all!</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/freeagent-support.png" alt="A picture of the Freeagent support team" /></p>

<p><small>Our first pass at adding this feature didn’t have a Support contact field but rather gave our email and telephone number</small></p>

<h2 id="what-actually-happened">What actually happened?</h2>

<p>Once we launched our first iteration of the usefulness tracker we found something surprising in how our users interacted with it.</p>

<p>At no point in the journey did we tell them that the feedback they provided was anything more than anonymous. We didn’t ask for any contact details (and so would have no way of getting back to them anyway).</p>

<p>Yet in the first weekend we found that how we thought they would use it and the reality of how they used it differed wildly from our exceptions. Rather than telling us why a specific article wasn’t useful our users were asking support questions.</p>

<p>This of course presented a problem. With no contact details we would have no way to get back to them, and this information was never even meant for our support team - it wouldn’t leave the confines of our CMS and analytics - so in essence it just ended up in a support black hole.</p>

<p>While we did provide the support contact details at this stage we also realised we had no way of tracking if these users took their enquiry any further (and anyone in a marketing background will tell you that unless you have a specific email address and telephone number related to a channel - it’s difficult, if near impossible to track).</p>

<p>We quickly pulled the plug on the comment system and went back to the drawing board.</p>

<h2 id="giving-users-what-they-actually-want">Giving users what they actually want</h2>

<p>After some discussion we decided; rather than putting in place a workflow of what we expect our users to follow it was up to us to give them what they expect.</p>

<p>The next iteration did this by adding a specific step after the ‘no’ response - prompt them and ask ‘Do you want to contact our support?’ or ‘Would you rather just leave feedback?’</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/improved-feedback.png" alt="Improved calls to action" /></p>

<p><small>We further refined the calls to action, directing users down the correct path</small></p>

<p>By framing the question this way we found that we gained the added benefit of allowing us to track support request coming from this channel.</p>

<p>We now show a form that asks users their contact details and support request which we then send to a specific email that is integrated to our Zendesk and allows us to tag these incoming support requests as coming from the right channel.</p>

<p>We still give the them the option of providing just feedback - but we are more specific about this route; and even after they have done this we tell the user they are still free to contact our support team by providing a link that will re-present the support form to them.</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/freeagent-contact-form.png" alt="Improved calls to action" /></p>

<p><small>Users could now directly contact out support team by a simple form - and this gave us a better way to track the channel that the request came from</small></p>

<h2 id="turn-that-frown-upside-down">Turn that frown upside down</h2>

<p>When I first saw the responses users were giving I was surprised and a little upset.</p>

<p>To me it felt as if our idea was worthless, and had a net negative effect to our users. They were asking us questions and we had no way to respond!</p>

<p>But by taking a step back and thinking about what they actually wanted I realised that unexpected behaviour is not necessarily a negative thing and should be embraced.</p>

<p>If you release something and begin to get frustrated that your users don’t understand your vision - take a step back and see it from their perspective - you might find yourself surprised and be able to improve your product for both them and yourself.</p>
