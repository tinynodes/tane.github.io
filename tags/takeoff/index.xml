      <description>The 1903 Wright Flyer is a small, fabric covered piece of engineering that will live on as one of the most important achievements of mankind in the 20th century, and probably in all of our recorded history. The original plane was restored after its last flight, which had resulted in a crash-landing, and is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.
Today I have released the first feature release of Takeoff (which now has a new home on Github under it’s own organisation).</description>

      <description>A common complaint I hear about hack days, and development in general is that there is far too much up front investment in boilerplate infrastructure.
To get a simple React app running you need to spend half the day just getting webpack and babel working, and then you need to work on your API and have to pick a framework.
This is where Takeoff comes in. It’s a development environment designed for rapid prototyping.</description>
