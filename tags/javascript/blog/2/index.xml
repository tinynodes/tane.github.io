The query is also available in JavaScript using the window.</description></item><item><title>Creating Custom RxJS Operators</title><link>https://tane.dev/2021/01/creating-custom-rxjs-operators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2021 00:15:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2021/01/creating-custom-rxjs-operators/</guid><description>RxJS is a popular library available for TypeScript and JavaScript.
It provides APIs for the creation of applications and libraries using asynchronous streams of data and reactive methods. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the foundation libraries of Angular .
Included in it are over 100 operators - functions that take an Observable stream of data and return values for use in chains of operators.
Many of the operators are low level, and combining them through the pipe method they create a powerful way to work with data.</description></item><item><title>RxJS Ninja Updates - New operators for math and working with streams</title><link>https://tane.dev/2021/01/rxjs-ninja-updates-new-operators-for-math-and-working-with-streams/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2021 00:15:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2021/01/rxjs-ninja-updates-new-operators-for-math-and-working-with-streams/</guid><description>Since the last update on RxJS Ninja there have been a few new operators added, below are some details and links to StackBlitz demos showing them in action.
Numbers and Math operators In @rxjs-ninja/rxjs-number the missing toFixed operator has been added, alongside a new custom toHex operator and the corresponding parseHex one allowing hex numbers to be worked with ( such as converting colours)
There are also new operators for some basic math - add , sub , div , mul , mod and pow all allowing you to modify source numbers, all accept a number, or an Observable number source.</description></item><item><title>RxJS Primitives is now RxJS Ninja</title><link>https://tane.dev/2020/11/rxjs-primitives-is-now-rxjs-ninja/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:01:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2020/11/rxjs-primitives-is-now-rxjs-ninja/</guid><description>Today I&amp;rsquo;ve re-released RxJS Primitives as RxJS Ninja . The new libraries have been published as the same last versions under their old name, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to migrate to the new version - all now published under @rxjs-ninja instead of @tinynodes (a deprecation notice has also been left the old packages).</description></item><item><title>New RxJS Primitives release, new operators + Typescript 4</title><link>https://tane.dev/2020/11/new-rxjs-primitives-release-new-operators--typescript-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 11:30:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2020/11/new-rxjs-primitives-release-new-operators--typescript-4/</guid><description>This week I released new versions of my RxJS libraries in rxjs-primitives . Since it&amp;rsquo;s released I&amp;rsquo;ve added a few new utility operators. Some of these have been out for a while since I originally wrote about the release, so I&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted them here as they may be useful to some developers.
You can check out the full docs here .
Typescript 4 Upgrading to Typescript 4 has allowed the removal of polymorphic functions in place of Vardic Tuple Types and is why there is a major bump on all packages.</description></item></channel></rss>
