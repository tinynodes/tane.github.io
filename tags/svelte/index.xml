Like any good responsible software engineer, instead of taking to social media or forums to post about the exploit - I opted to report it to HackerOne - where Slack accepts reports of potential security exploits.</description></item><item><title>I Think I Found a Privacy Exploit in ChatGPT</title><link>https://tane.dev/2023/04/i-think-i-found-a-privacy-exploit-in-chatgpt/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:50:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2023/04/i-think-i-found-a-privacy-exploit-in-chatgpt/</guid><description>&amp;gt; tl;dr: I discovered that passing empty prompts to ChatGPT still generates responses Initially, I thought these might be hallucinations, but now I suspect they could also include other users' responses from the API
Last month, OpenAI unveiled their advanced large language model, ChatGPT-4 , attracting attention from developers, enterprises, media, and governments alike.
Before receiving my GPT-4 invite, I experimented with alpaca.cpp , designed to run models on CPU&amp;rsquo;s with limited memory constraints.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Formula - A Zero-Config Reactive Forms Library for Svelte</title><link>https://tane.dev/2021/02/announcing-formula-a-zero-config-reactive-forms-library-for-svelte/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2021/02/announcing-formula-a-zero-config-reactive-forms-library-for-svelte/</guid><description>Demo NPM Page Today I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the release of Svelte Formula - a new forms library for Svelte .
Formula is a Zero-Config library - what this means is that you do not have to pass any settings to the library itself to handle form validation and submission - it uses the validation properties of HTML5 forms directly, meaning you can create progressive, accessible forms first.
The library is for use with the use directive and can be bound to any element, not just &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; ones and the library automatically handles subscription and unsubscription to any form element with a name attribute.</description></item><item><title>Revisiting Dark patterns with the HTML &lt;dialog> tag</title><link>https://tane.dev/2021/02/revisiting-dark-patterns-with-the-html-dialog-tag/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 22:50:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2021/02/revisiting-dark-patterns-with-the-html-dialog-tag/</guid><description>Every once in a while I&amp;rsquo;ll see frontend developers tweet or blog about how great the HTML dialog tag is and each time I&amp;rsquo;m reminded me of an old Medium post I made a few years ago about its use.
The good news is in 2021 it&amp;rsquo;s much harder to use it to crash a user&amp;rsquo;s browser - in Firefox dialog.showModal is behind a flag so it has to be specifically enabled by users.</description></item><item><title>WebSerial.app - Browser to USB Serial Communication With Svelte</title><link>https://tane.dev/2021/02/webserial.app-browser-to-usb-serial-communication-with-svelte/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 21:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2021/02/webserial.app-browser-to-usb-serial-communication-with-svelte/</guid><description>After my previous experiments with the Web Serial API, I started experimenting with Svelte .
Within a couple of days I have created https://webserial.app/ - the Web Serial Controller app.
The interface might seem familiar - it&amp;rsquo;s based on XP.css - a Windows XP CSS theme. It was inspired by some of the Serial hardware software used in the 00&amp;rsquo;s.
The application is fully open source and features:
Fully connected state - use the screens or keyboard shortcuts to connect and disconnect from devices with shared state Filter devices by vendor ID with a fully searchable list of all hardware vendors A draggable interface XP-like interface Options storage in localStorage Send text messages to any connected device</description></item></channel></rss>
