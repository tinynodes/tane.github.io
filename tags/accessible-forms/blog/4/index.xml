The module is a set of features for Angular (7+) to create and control EditorJS instances.
A demo application is available to see the editor in action, and the source is also available in the &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;@tinynodes&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; monorepo .
Included Features The library exports several features once the NgxEditorJSModule has been included in your project.
NgxEditorJSDirective This is the main directive which can be used on any element with the [ngxEditorJS] selector and and id attribute.</description></item><item><title>Providing injectable features to Angular modules</title><link>https://tane.dev/2019/03/providing-injectable-features-to-angular-modules/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 20:30:00 +0100</pubDate><author>spam@tane.dev (Tane Piper)</author><guid>https://tane.dev/2019/03/providing-injectable-features-to-angular-modules/</guid><description>Working with Angular and Typescript ; as I have refactored and re-written components I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning to take advantage of one of the more powerful features - dependency injection.
Building Angular components, most developers will have already used this to inject features like the HTTP client or the FormBuilder to be used in a component. A common service example might look like this:

Also recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been dissatisfied with the way Medium has dealt with recent changes (although I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into all the reasons except to say I&amp;rsquo;d rather own and control all my content).
The site is Markdown powered, generated with Hugo and served via GitHub Pages with a CI deployment.</description></item></channel></rss>
