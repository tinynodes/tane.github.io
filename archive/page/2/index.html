<p>At FreeAgent one of the goals of our Customer Experience team has been to improve the quality of content on our Knowledge Base.</p>

<p>From humble beginnings it has grown into sprawling, organic collection of documents containing over 250 pages of content. Over the years has built up to cover everything from setting up FreeAgent, to telling you about the tasks you can carry out to run your business and even stubs of support responses on how certain tasks might be (or not be) carried out.</p>

<p>As part of redesigning the content we decided to implement a ‘usefulness tracker’ allowing us to gather customer metrics. We would use this information to inform us as to which articles actually helped our users and what ones ended up being dead-ends with no where else to go.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>

<p>We ended up designing a relatively simple two step process. At the bottom of every page we ask the users if they found the article useful via two buttons for ‘yes’ and ‘no’. We used a combination of a custom CMS application and Google Analytics to do the tracking.</p>

<p>If they did find an article useful, then great! We take that vote and record it against the article which allows us to see quickly which ones need less of our immediate attention. Job done.</p>

<p>However if the user said ‘no’ then we presented them with a simple comment field allowing them to give us that extra level of detail in their feedback. We hoped this would allow us to understand why that page was failing and then use that as part of a feedback loop to further improve the content.</p>

<p>We also presented the user with a friendly picture of our support team and contact details - we don’t want to abandon these users after all!</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/freeagent-support.png" alt="A picture of the Freeagent support team" /></p>

<p><small>Our first pass at adding this feature didn’t have a Support contact field but rather gave our email and telephone number</small></p>

<h2 id="what-actually-happened">What actually happened?</h2>

<p>Once we launched our first iteration of the usefulness tracker we found something surprising in how our users interacted with it.</p>

<p>At no point in the journey did we tell them that the feedback they provided was anything more than anonymous. We didn’t ask for any contact details (and so would have no way of getting back to them anyway).</p>

<p>Yet in the first weekend we found that how we thought they would use it and the reality of how they used it differed wildly from our exceptions. Rather than telling us why a specific article wasn’t useful our users were asking support questions.</p>

<p>This of course presented a problem. With no contact details we would have no way to get back to them, and this information was never even meant for our support team - it wouldn’t leave the confines of our CMS and analytics - so in essence it just ended up in a support black hole.</p>

<p>While we did provide the support contact details at this stage we also realised we had no way of tracking if these users took their enquiry any further (and anyone in a marketing background will tell you that unless you have a specific email address and telephone number related to a channel - it’s difficult, if near impossible to track).</p>

<p>We quickly pulled the plug on the comment system and went back to the drawing board.</p>

<h2 id="giving-users-what-they-actually-want">Giving users what they actually want</h2>

<p>After some discussion we decided; rather than putting in place a workflow of what we expect our users to follow it was up to us to give them what they expect.</p>

<p>The next iteration did this by adding a specific step after the ‘no’ response - prompt them and ask ‘Do you want to contact our support?’ or ‘Would you rather just leave feedback?’</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/improved-feedback.png" alt="Improved calls to action" /></p>

<p><small>We further refined the calls to action, directing users down the correct path</small></p>

<p>By framing the question this way we found that we gained the added benefit of allowing us to track support request coming from this channel.</p>

<p>We now show a form that asks users their contact details and support request which we then send to a specific email that is integrated to our Zendesk and allows us to tag these incoming support requests as coming from the right channel.</p>

<p>We still give the them the option of providing just feedback - but we are more specific about this route; and even after they have done this we tell the user they are still free to contact our support team by providing a link that will re-present the support form to them.</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/freeagent-contact-form.png" alt="Improved calls to action" /></p>

<p><small>Users could now directly contact out support team by a simple form - and this gave us a better way to track the channel that the request came from</small></p>

<h2 id="turn-that-frown-upside-down">Turn that frown upside down</h2>

<p>When I first saw the responses users were giving I was surprised and a little upset.</p>

<p>To me it felt as if our idea was worthless, and had a net negative effect to our users. They were asking us questions and we had no way to respond!</p>

<p>But by taking a step back and thinking about what they actually wanted I realised that unexpected behaviour is not necessarily a negative thing and should be embraced.</p>

<p>If you release something and begin to get frustrated that your users don’t understand your vision - take a step back and see it from their perspective - you might find yourself surprised and be able to improve your product for both them and yourself.</p>
