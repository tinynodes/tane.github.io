<h3 id="how-lack-of-ambition-killed-my-competitor-to-github">How lack of ambition killed my competitor to GitHub</h3>

<p>What follows is a tale of sadness and procrastination and what could have been had I been a better developer. Or maybe it would have been nothing - but I like to dream that maybe in some alternative universe what happened below didn’t go down the same way.</p>

<p>Today, GitHub is one of the most popular destinations on the web for developers - in fact I don’t know any developer who doesn’t have GitHub account.</p>

<p>Any big project out there that is open source, and many private companies use it as the most productive way to share and collaborate on code.</p>

<p>Hgfront itself was a collaboration of several people - with myself leading the team and doing most of the design and coding and we had a simple idea.</p>

<p>We wanted to allow the management and creation of Mercurial respositories via a web interface - something that would allow more non-technical people to set up shared repositories.</p>

<p>At the time it wasn’t easy. You have to have an understanding of Mercurial’s web interface, Apache 2 and mod_python - and how to get them to all work together nicely.</p>

<p>We were doing this back in 2007 - as of January 2008 we came along at a reasonable pace (as this crudely made video on Youtube show) - we didn’t have a great design or anything too exciting but as a feature list, what we did have was:</p>

<p>Account and project creation
Repository creation and cloning
Issue tracking, with basic tagging and milestones
Github didn’t launch until April 2008, and I believe if we had the ambition then I could have actually done something with this. As it was no one on the team had the ambition to push through to release anything, and soon the project died. Bitbucket - a very similar project to ours launched soon after - and the rest they say is history.</p>

<p>Oh I was doing Gists too in 2006
In 2006 I also worked on a collaborative pastebin application called PasteMonkey. At the time most pastebin applications were pretty simple - they have a text entry, language selection and code output screen.</p>

<p>I wanted to build something different - so PasteMonkey was born. Out the box it had most of the standard pastebin features - including code highlighting - but also included:</p>

<p>A tab-based editor for code entry with dynamic resizing
The ability to fork and diff versions of pastes, and paginate through versions
Inline, per-line commenting (actually kind of similar to what is on Medium with the icons down the side)
Taxonomy of tagging entries, and a public discovery system
Of course all of this stuff was Ajaxy and JavaScript heavy - something that wasn’t that common at the time either.</p>

<p>I can’t find an exact date, but I think Github launched Gist in 2010 (and if anyone can correct me if I’m wrong?)</p>

<p>When I look back on this, it makes me kick myself - if only I had the ambition to push myself to do something with this software.</p>

<p>I remarked in a previous post I’m a bit of a procrastinator and it has lead to me being a 31 year old guy who had chances in the past and blew it.</p>

<p>I do believe where I live too had something to do with it - certainly at the the time Scotland had no entrepreneurial spirit - nothing like out in the US. If I wanted to do anything with this, I would have had to have based myself out of London and at the time was something I was not willing to do.</p>

<p>Of course things change - Scotland is much better at this stuff these days, but for me the time has passed on these projects.</p>

<p>I thought of trying to bring them up to date, even if just to try get some up to date screenshots - but I’m hoping to better use my time on some other projects that I hope finally I will push through that barrier with.</p>

<p>I also think it’s kind of funny that they both ended up as open source on GitHub.</p>
