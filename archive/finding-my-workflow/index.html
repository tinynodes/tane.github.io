<h2 id="my-journey-through-procrastination-and-laziness">My journey through procrastination and laziness</h2>

<p>I’ve always found one of the hardest thing for me to achieve has been to focus on the job at hand. I’ve been a professional developer for over 10 years and I look at other developers - online and my peers - and see that somehow they manage to plan effectively their time and resources to successfully complete all the tasks at hand.</p>

<p>Frankly it makes me jealous. I’ve tried several techniques that I’ve learned from reading online and in books, and never found anything that worked for me.</p>

<p>Recently though something came into my life that has been changing that, a piece of technology that finally is the perfect fit for me and that is my iPad Mini.</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/my-old-ipad.jpg" alt="My Old iPad" /></p>

<p>I switched to the Apple ecosystem just over a year ago after many years of resistance but I found that I was working with more Mac developers and found it easier to make the switch. I ditched Android after 4 years as well (I had the first G1 handset the day it came out) mostly through frustration - for the most part it just “didn’t work” as advertised.</p>

<p>By having my laptop, phone and tablet device be all in the same ecosystem it has allowed me to take advantage of some excellent tools - and these I am finding have made my work day a lot more tollerable.</p>

<p>Side note: I am not a fervent Apple “fan boy” - sometimes I find their activity still verging on a cult-like status. What I do like is that they do solid hardware and have allowed for a great set of apps to grow within their ecosystem - and for the most part it all does “just work”.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have sidetracked enough on the hardware - so lets get down to the software.</p>

<h2 id="my-indispensable-apps-list">My indispensable apps list</h2>

<p>These are the apps that I use almost every day in some way. It’s not an exhaustive list - in fact it’s rather short, but why have fifty tools when you can have a few great ones that really help. Most of them listed have a OSX and iOS version - allowing for integration of data while at home, work or on the move.</p>

<p>Through this list one thing I am not going to do is tell you how to use them - I found that is a futile exercise for most people. Everyone has their own way of using apps and this is more a guide to what tools are available to help improve everyday workflow.</p>

<h3 id="evernote-penultimate">Evernote + Penultimate</h3>

<p>Evernote was one of the first apps I used on the Mac - I had been recommended it by several people as a way to store notes online, from quick notes on the go to whole email threads that I could track the progress of. It’s one of the few apps I do have a workflow for - using The Secret Weapon GTD system, although I have found myself using it less and less these days in favour of better organised notebooks.</p>

<p>When I got my stylus pen I also installed Penultimate from Evernote as a more general note taking, and sketching app. It’s great for those crappy drawings I would make on bits of paper that I’d end up loosing - but instead now I have them synced to one central place that I can later decide to keep or dump them.</p>

<p>One aside here I would make is on stylus choice - don’t go cheap. The one I have cost me £6.99 and it shows. It’s a great addition to the iPad but I wish I had got a better quality one. I’m going to shortly upgrade to either a Bamboo or Pogo one soon, and it might be a good topic for a post in the future.</p>

<h3 id="day-one">Day One</h3>

<p>I’ve tried keeping diaries in the past - personal ones, development ones and even task-based diaries but again couldn’t find anything that encouraged me to keep it up beyond a few weeks.</p>

<p>That changed after I bought Day One. It’s not only a great note taking tool but the features it includes such as tagging, photo attachments and weather and location attachment to individual entries allows you to build up context-aware content around your daily life. Out the box it also support Markdown content, which is a great way to write your documents.</p>

<p>Integration is via iCloud or Dropbox - I’d recommend the Dropbox integration as it’s more reliable, as well as allowing you you back up to it.</p>

<p>If anything it’s the one tool I wish I used more - it does have a reminder feature, encouraging you to write your entries with pithy little messages and quotes in it’s notification popup - but I do find that if I’m not in the mood for writing or too busy, it’s easy to just tell it to go away and I forget to come back.</p>

<h3 id="ia-writer">iA Writer</h3>

<p>Before this blog post (which I am doing in Mediums own interface and loving it!) most of the more creative writing I had been doing in the past few months had been in iA Writer.</p>

<p>iA Writer has a unique interface on both OSX and iOS that provides a great distraction-free writing environment through getting rid of the standard chrome around the window, and focus mode that only highlights the lines you are working on at the time. Like Day One, it also support Markdown content.</p>

<h3 id="paper">Paper</h3>

<p>One thing I’ve always tried is to find a a hobby that isn’t coding, and while I enjoy photography I always found that I could never be bothered to carry about a bulky camera - preferring to use the likes of Instagram or Flickr on my iPhone to take pictures. Along with this I wanted to discover my more creative side and last month I found the perfect tool for it.</p>

<p>Paper is designed for iPad and stylus pens and provides a set of artistic tool for me to explore that more creative side. Within the sketchbooks it provides two pens, a pencil, a highlighter and paintbrush - along with colour palettes and mixers - driven by an ‘expressive’ ink engine.</p>

<p><img src="https://tinynodes.github.io/archive/images/ipad-painting,jpg" alt="An old iPad painting" /></p>

<p>It’s been over 15 years since I last painted anything at school - and I’ve found that it’s something I enjoy again - so I’ve combined my love for taking photos with my new found joy of using Paper - now when I walk my dog, I take notice of my surroundings and try capture pictures that I want to paint later. So far my attempts are not stunning, but it’s relaxing and certainly nice to get away from a computer screen full of code.</p>
