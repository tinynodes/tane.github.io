<h2 id="my-year-of-hell-through-burnout-sickness-and-the-looming-threat-of-unemployment">My year of hell through burnout, sickness and the looming threat of unemployment</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>My original version of this post was several years ago but much of it still applies today. Developer burnout can be hard, and some people don’t fully recover from it.</p>

<p>I still feel to this day what happened had a big impact on me - luckily I managed to turn things around for myself with employment but as a developer I still feel the knock-on effects to this day.</p>

<p>The post has been edited to bring it up to date, and I’ve even edited some of the values - time and maturity have allowed me to re-assess what happened on the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was July 2011 and I was about to go on a long planned holiday, my first holiday in three years.</p>

<p>My first wife was a full time student doing a law degree I have been working working flat out in that time on various jobs to support her with agency work, freelance and even a startup. It was that last one that had finally done me in.</p>

<p>I was experiencing developer burnout and the holiday couldn’t come soon enough. When I returned in two weeks later though I have to face the cold reality that I was also going to be an unemployed.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-all-began">How it all began</h2>

<p>The year before I was introduced to the two partners who were looking to start a business. Both were non-technical, came from public sector backgrounds but experts in their field. We discussed salary and agreed an equity deal that would see me get 5% of the company + another 5% once the product started selling (which in hindsight wasn’t actually the best deal).</p>

<p>We were going to build a new product together, something never seen on the market for the disaster recovery and business continuity sector and I was essentially made CTO - that gave me the chance to work with the technologies on my choice.</p>

<p>The project was bold; the application hooked together a lot of elements of managing an Organisation, the people, it’s assets and linking them to business processes (lot of tree structures and database relationships across multiple types of data) and had to work in real time. If the shit hit the fan for a business, they needed immediate access to all this date.</p>

<p>I was given a 50 page document of mostly user interface ideas, and told to go away and start building the application.</p>

<h2 id="this-was-the-first-mistake">This was the first mistake.</h2>

<p>My experience at the time had been mostly in PHP and Python, building reasonably large scale websites. As a technology choice I started with Django - but about a month in, it just wasn’t fitting; I had to hack too many things relating to the database and I decided to re-assess the whole thing.</p>

<p>Around this time Nodejs and CouchDB were starting to make an impact - people were talking about it as the “next great thing” (and for the most part they weren’t wrong). After learning the APIs I started creating an initial application with it I decided to use it with an ExtJS client driving user interface.</p>

<p>A lot of the really technical back end aspects were done quite quickly, and it turned out the technology was a good fit, but as the only developer I had to drive everything from project management to database design, all the client side and user interface and everything in between. This went on for about five-six months, pretty much 18 hours a day. At the same time, I wasn’t interacting with many people outside my home office, including the founders.</p>

<h2 id="this-was-the-second-mistake">This was the second mistake.</h2>

<p>We met maybe once a month at the most in the beginning, but in that time I still managed to build a good part of the core product on my own.</p>

<p>However without constant meetings and feedback the first thing I noticed is that what was starting to form was less of anything to do with the business logic and understand how the app would drive the data, and what I was building was basically a framework.</p>

<p>At around the 5 month mark or so, things started to go a downhill and quickly slid from there. For them is was all about what they called ‘the shiney shiney’.</p>

<h2 id="the-third-mistake">The third mistake</h2>

<p>From speaking to others, and attending TechMeetup occasionally I had a some knowledge of other startups and the idea of a MVP. However I came to realise quickly that the other partners came from public sector backgrounds - there was no Agile “release early - release often” here, they wanted the full product done - all-singing, all-dancing features (think a database driven Visio) for launch and it was all or nothing for them.</p>

<p>An MVP was unacceptable and there was no courting angel investors - they wanted to retain as much control as possible.</p>

<p>Stress was stating to kick in, my brain wasn’t working at the same pace or same clarity was it was 6 months before and at this point I started making some terrible choices.</p>

<p>Sencha, the makers of ExtJS had promised delivery of an all-new ExtJS4. From the videos from SenchaCon they demonstrated that it had lots of great new feature for doing charts and drawing, exactly what we needed. They seemed confident the final release would be out in February 2011 so we made a decision - based on my recommendation - to slow things down a bit and wait for it to come out.</p>

<p>So we waited; and we waited.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, the release never happened as expected. I should have known this - after all I am a developer and I know that things never go to plan.</p>

<p>The features we wanted to focus on using never really materialised as we expected it and when their developer released did finally start landing, I began the effort of porting the application over. However things were incomplete and the APIs were terrible.</p>

<p>Stupidly I was trying to do this myself. No other developer was available to help work on the many interconnected parts of the application, and it was up to me to keep the momentum going and quickly I started to get overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Then the money ran out.</p>

<p>Unlike your typical startup, there was no push for funding - there was basically what was in the pot, and nothing else - I was now expected to work for sweat equity. My wife was still only working part time, coming up to the final few months of her degree and we still had bills and rent to pay.</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelming stress that was piling on I had to start looking for extra work and I managed to land a few contract jobs, some at fixed rate and some at a decent day rate - but because the situation I was put in I had to bust my balls to make sure money came in on time, while still expected to work on the other product in my own time.</p>

<p>Finally the burnout kicked in full force. I wasn’t able to sleep, I became cranky and angry and I started to ignore everyone around me - including the founders.</p>

<p>To top it off my wife fell ill. Two years earlier she had been diagnosed with Crohns disease, and had major surgery to correct the damage. We had been told to expect that at some time in the future she would fall ill again, and she did - but it ended up being her gall bladder.</p>

<p>It was around this time as well I finally decided to end the relationship with the startup. With a contract we had only agreed to work 6 months and I thought that would be plenty time for an MVP, and it could have been - but they wanted more, and without being able to actually pay me it was time to end the project here.</p>

<p>I felt sad, but at the same time a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.</p>

<p>I took me several months after that to recover and the holiday really helped. I bought a camera and started doing photography - I disconnected myself from the internet as much as possible and I think this, and being out in the sun was what I needed.</p>

<p>If I had continued down the other path I don’t know where I would be now but I don’t think it would have been good.</p>

<p>Luckily a local agency got in touch and asked me to do some on-site freelance work at a very good rate - higher than I had been ever paid before. Also being on-site, I was around people again - being able to bounce ideas off each other and socialise.</p>

<p>I now believe this is one of the most important things a developer can ever do beyond the needs of their day-to-day job.</p>

<p>After this, things started getting better again.</p>

<p>My wife recovered fast and later that year sat her Diploma in legal practice after completing her LLB with first class honours. She starts as a trainee prosecutor for the Crown Office later this year.</p>

<p>After a short stint with with the agency, in January 2011 I started working for FreeAgent as a frontend developer - although that job has turned into also managing a lot of legacy PHP.</p>

<p>To anyone reading this who themselves may be feeling developer burnout - take a step back and realise that it can get better!</p>

<h3 id="how-lack-of-ambition-killed-my-competitor-to-github">How lack of ambition killed my competitor to GitHub</h3>

<p>What follows is a tale of sadness and procrastination and what could have been had I been a better developer. Or maybe it would have been nothing - but I like to dream that maybe in some alternative universe what happened below didn’t go down the same way.</p>

<p>Today, GitHub is one of the most popular destinations on the web for developers - in fact I don’t know any developer who doesn’t have GitHub account.</p>

<p>Any big project out there that is open source, and many private companies use it as the most productive way to share and collaborate on code.</p>

<p>Hgfront itself was a collaboration of several people - with myself leading the team and doing most of the design and coding and we had a simple idea.</p>

<p>We wanted to allow the management and creation of Mercurial respositories via a web interface - something that would allow more non-technical people to set up shared repositories.</p>

<p>At the time it wasn’t easy. You have to have an understanding of Mercurial’s web interface, Apache 2 and mod_python - and how to get them to all work together nicely.</p>

<p>We were doing this back in 2007 - as of January 2008 we came along at a reasonable pace (as this crudely made video on Youtube show) - we didn’t have a great design or anything too exciting but as a feature list, what we did have was:</p>

<p>Account and project creation
Repository creation and cloning
Issue tracking, with basic tagging and milestones
Github didn’t launch until April 2008, and I believe if we had the ambition then I could have actually done something with this. As it was no one on the team had the ambition to push through to release anything, and soon the project died. Bitbucket - a very similar project to ours launched soon after - and the rest they say is history.</p>

<p>Oh I was doing Gists too in 2006
In 2006 I also worked on a collaborative pastebin application called PasteMonkey. At the time most pastebin applications were pretty simple - they have a text entry, language selection and code output screen.</p>

<p>I wanted to build something different - so PasteMonkey was born. Out the box it had most of the standard pastebin features - including code highlighting - but also included:</p>

<p>A tab-based editor for code entry with dynamic resizing
The ability to fork and diff versions of pastes, and paginate through versions
Inline, per-line commenting (actually kind of similar to what is on Medium with the icons down the side)
Taxonomy of tagging entries, and a public discovery system
Of course all of this stuff was Ajaxy and JavaScript heavy - something that wasn’t that common at the time either.</p>

<p>I can’t find an exact date, but I think Github launched Gist in 2010 (and if anyone can correct me if I’m wrong?)</p>

<p>When I look back on this, it makes me kick myself - if only I had the ambition to push myself to do something with this software.</p>

<p>I remarked in a previous post I’m a bit of a procrastinator and it has lead to me being a 31 year old guy who had chances in the past and blew it.</p>

<p>I do believe where I live too had something to do with it - certainly at the the time Scotland had no entrepreneurial spirit - nothing like out in the US. If I wanted to do anything with this, I would have had to have based myself out of London and at the time was something I was not willing to do.</p>

<p>Of course things change - Scotland is much better at this stuff these days, but for me the time has passed on these projects.</p>

<p>I thought of trying to bring them up to date, even if just to try get some up to date screenshots - but I’m hoping to better use my time on some other projects that I hope finally I will push through that barrier with.</p>

<p>I also think it’s kind of funny that they both ended up as open source on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="my-journey-through-procrastination-and-laziness">My journey through procrastination and laziness</h2>

<p>I’ve always found one of the hardest thing for me to achieve has been to focus on the job at hand. I’ve been a professional developer for over 10 years and I look at other developers - online and my peers - and see that somehow they manage to plan effectively their time and resources to successfully complete all the tasks at hand.</p>

<p>Frankly it makes me jealous. I’ve tried several techniques that I’ve learned from reading online and in books, and never found anything that worked for me.</p>

<p>Recently though something came into my life that has been changing that, a piece of technology that finally is the perfect fit for me and that is my iPad Mini.</p>

<p><img src="http://tinynodes.xyz/archive/images/my-old-ipad.jpg" alt="My Old iPad" /></p>

<p>I switched to the Apple ecosystem just over a year ago after many years of resistance but I found that I was working with more Mac developers and found it easier to make the switch. I ditched Android after 4 years as well (I had the first G1 handset the day it came out) mostly through frustration - for the most part it just “didn’t work” as advertised.</p>

<p>By having my laptop, phone and tablet device be all in the same ecosystem it has allowed me to take advantage of some excellent tools - and these I am finding have made my work day a lot more tollerable.</p>

<p>Side note: I am not a fervent Apple “fan boy” - sometimes I find their activity still verging on a cult-like status. What I do like is that they do solid hardware and have allowed for a great set of apps to grow within their ecosystem - and for the most part it all does “just work”.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have sidetracked enough on the hardware - so lets get down to the software.</p>

<h2 id="my-indispensable-apps-list">My indispensable apps list</h2>

<p>These are the apps that I use almost every day in some way. It’s not an exhaustive list - in fact it’s rather short, but why have fifty tools when you can have a few great ones that really help. Most of them listed have a OSX and iOS version - allowing for integration of data while at home, work or on the move.</p>

<p>Through this list one thing I am not going to do is tell you how to use them - I found that is a futile exercise for most people. Everyone has their own way of using apps and this is more a guide to what tools are available to help improve everyday workflow.</p>

<h3 id="evernote-penultimate">Evernote + Penultimate</h3>

<p>Evernote was one of the first apps I used on the Mac - I had been recommended it by several people as a way to store notes online, from quick notes on the go to whole email threads that I could track the progress of. It’s one of the few apps I do have a workflow for - using The Secret Weapon GTD system, although I have found myself using it less and less these days in favour of better organised notebooks.</p>

<p>When I got my stylus pen I also installed Penultimate from Evernote as a more general note taking, and sketching app. It’s great for those crappy drawings I would make on bits of paper that I’d end up loosing - but instead now I have them synced to one central place that I can later decide to keep or dump them.</p>

<p>One aside here I would make is on stylus choice - don’t go cheap. The one I have cost me £6.99 and it shows. It’s a great addition to the iPad but I wish I had got a better quality one. I’m going to shortly upgrade to either a Bamboo or Pogo one soon, and it might be a good topic for a post in the future.</p>

<h3 id="day-one">Day One</h3>

<p>I’ve tried keeping diaries in the past - personal ones, development ones and even task-based diaries but again couldn’t find anything that encouraged me to keep it up beyond a few weeks.</p>

<p>That changed after I bought Day One. It’s not only a great note taking tool but the features it includes such as tagging, photo attachments and weather and location attachment to individual entries allows you to build up context-aware content around your daily life. Out the box it also support Markdown content, which is a great way to write your documents.</p>

<p>Integration is via iCloud or Dropbox - I’d recommend the Dropbox integration as it’s more reliable, as well as allowing you you back up to it.</p>

<p>If anything it’s the one tool I wish I used more - it does have a reminder feature, encouraging you to write your entries with pithy little messages and quotes in it’s notification popup - but I do find that if I’m not in the mood for writing or too busy, it’s easy to just tell it to go away and I forget to come back.</p>

<h3 id="ia-writer">iA Writer</h3>

<p>Before this blog post (which I am doing in Mediums own interface and loving it!) most of the more creative writing I had been doing in the past few months had been in iA Writer.</p>

<p>iA Writer has a unique interface on both OSX and iOS that provides a great distraction-free writing environment through getting rid of the standard chrome around the window, and focus mode that only highlights the lines you are working on at the time. Like Day One, it also support Markdown content.</p>

<h3 id="paper">Paper</h3>

<p>One thing I’ve always tried is to find a a hobby that isn’t coding, and while I enjoy photography I always found that I could never be bothered to carry about a bulky camera - preferring to use the likes of Instagram or Flickr on my iPhone to take pictures. Along with this I wanted to discover my more creative side and last month I found the perfect tool for it.</p>

<p>Paper is designed for iPad and stylus pens and provides a set of artistic tool for me to explore that more creative side. Within the sketchbooks it provides two pens, a pencil, a highlighter and paintbrush - along with colour palettes and mixers - driven by an ‘expressive’ ink engine.</p>

<p><img src="http://tinynodes.xyz/archive/images/ipad-painting,jpg" alt="An old iPad painting" /></p>

<p>It’s been over 15 years since I last painted anything at school - and I’ve found that it’s something I enjoy again - so I’ve combined my love for taking photos with my new found joy of using Paper - now when I walk my dog, I take notice of my surroundings and try capture pictures that I want to paint later. So far my attempts are not stunning, but it’s relaxing and certainly nice to get away from a computer screen full of code.</p>
